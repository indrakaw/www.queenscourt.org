Epoch 2,epoch2.rar,The sequel to the first Epoch.
Equilibrium,equilibrium.rar,A long intro to a game that never was.

Runic Legacy,Runic Legacy.rar,One of the first games to feature a CBS that was actually decent.
Se7en,Seven.rar,"I never got the concept of Rm2k/3 survival/horror games. Actually, I never got the concept of this genre in general, but roaming around a world full of stock lighting effects, Suikoden 2 rips, and standard off-the-net moans and other sound effects just doesn't appeal to me. But it might do it for you. And this game managed to keep my attention for a little longer than most do."
Seekers of the Sun,Seekers of the Sun.rar,"IMO, this game is heavily overrated. It's not a completely bad way to waste an hour and a half, though."

Unforgiven Quest,Unforgiven Quest.rar,Remade several times in 2000 and was very popular at rpgmaker.net.
Until My Finest Hour,UMFH.rar,"This was the prequel to In the Name of the Rose, created afterward. And when it was released, you needed a strong computer to handle the tons of picture effects. The presentation was over the top overdone, but this style made a lasting effect on the community. These days, you can probably run the game so it'll be fine, if short."
