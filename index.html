      <p>With the apparent closing of &quot;Liquid Motion&quot;, Bloodrose's two games, In the Name of the Rose and Until My Finest Hour, are hostless. He had opposed other sites hosting his games, but since his games appear to be abandonware now, you can find them in the game repository on the right. Hopefully my next update will come quicker.</p>

      <p>Just to let you know that I haven't vanished from the net, and the site's still being &quot;maintained&quot;, I've updated ... the bishoujo list.</p>

      <p>It's been a long time since this site has been updated. The Queen's Court (the game) is still in production, slowly but surely. In the meantime, to show that this site is not dead, I've uploaded a whopping 14 games to the Classic Rm2k/3 game listing on the right. Have fun!</p>
