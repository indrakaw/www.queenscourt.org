<p /><b>About the Misao Awards</b>
<p />
The Rm* Misaos are a yearly award given to RPG Maker games and creators ( this includes RPG Maker 2000, 2003, XP, and if someone is actually still using it, RPG Maker 95 ) in
various categories which are selected and voted on by the public. Generally, this is done in three rounds; a category nomination round, a game nomination round, and a voting round.
These awards are generally conducted across the entire English Rm* community each January. Previous winners are listed below. If you have any further questions about the awards, feel free to
contact iishenron <a href="http://www.queenscourt.org/forum/smf">here</a> or at #rm2k on irc.dynastynet.net. <br />
